Diwali and Sankranti Sales: Success Beyond Revenue

While incremental revenue (IR) is a crucial metric, it's crucial to remember that success doesn't solely depend on immediate revenue gains. Diwali and Sankranti sales exemplify this perfectly, demonstrating success in distinct ways:

Diwali Sales:

•	Focused on promoting higher-priced items: This strategy, even with a smaller sales volume increase, could contribute significantly to revenue due to higher profit margins.

•	Targeted campaigns: Diwali, being a major festival, might encourage consumers to splurge, leading to higher sales in the Rs. 1,000+ price group.

Sankranti Sales:

•	Effective inventory management: Shifting the promotion for Grocery & Staples from discounts to BOGOF successfully cleared stock while generating positive revenue.

•	Increased sales volume (ISU%): The Sankranti sales saw a significant surge in sales volume, particularly for lower-priced products, potentially indicating higher demand during this period.

These examples highlight the importance of understanding the broader impact of promotional campaigns. Focusing solely on revenue growth might miss the positive contributions to inventory management, brand awareness, and customer engagement, which ultimately pave the way for long-term business success.


In conclusion, both Diwali and Sankranti sales achieved success by strategically addressing different business objectives, demonstrating the importance of looking beyond immediate revenue figures to evaluate the comprehensive impact of promotional campaigns.
